Exercise 1a

Create a template class, that takes an arbitrary function as its template parameter.  Use the constructor to deduce the template types so user doesn't have to provide them.

 

Exercise 1b

Save the information about function return type (via using) and function arity (number of arguments) in the class.  (This requires you to template the return type and function parameters separately)

 

Exercise 1c

Create a function to test your class with.  Use decltype to printing out infomation contained without manually entering the template parameters.
